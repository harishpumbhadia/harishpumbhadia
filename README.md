### Hi there üëã

I am a Computer Science grad student studying in University of Texas at Arlington. Artificial Intelligence and Database Systems are the majors of my Masters of Science degree.

I have more than a year of real-world industry experience in the field of software development. I have worked mainly in java related technologies.

I firmly believe in Linus Torvalds‚Äôs words, he stated that ‚ÄúTheory and practice sometimes clash. And when that happens, theory loses. Every single time.‚Äù As a result, I have many projects in the journey of my undergraduate. It comprises a single webpage, mini-games, web applications, android applications, and management systems.

My area of interest are Software Engineering, Full-Stack Development, Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing  and Database Management.
